<h3>History Of Linus' Begining</h3>
<p>
    Torvalds first encountered the GNU Project in fall of 1991 when another Swedish-speaking computer science student, 
    Lars Wirzenius, took him to the University of Technology to listen to free software guru Richard Stallman's speech. 
    Torvalds would ultimately switch his original license (which forbade commercial use) to Stallman's GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) 
    for his Linux kernel after complaints of distributors being unable to recoup their costs due to a non-commercial clause.[25]

    IEEE Computer Society's Computer Pioneer Award. The Computer Pioneer Award was established in 1981 by the IEEE 
    Computer Society Board of Governors to recognize and honor the vision of those whose efforts resulted in the
     creation and continued vitality of the computer industry. The award is presented to outstanding individuals whose
